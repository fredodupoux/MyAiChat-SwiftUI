# Building an AI Chat App with SwiftUI
## Day 1: Foundation and Basic Chat Interface

---

# Welcome to Day 1! 👋
Today we'll build the foundation of our AI chat app

---

# Today's Goals 🎯

1. Set up our development environment
2. Create our data models
3. Build basic chat interface
4. Learn SwiftUI fundamentals

---

# Morning Session: Setup and Models

## Development Environment
- Create new Xcode project
- SwiftUI template
- iOS platform
- Name: "MyAiChat"

---

# Understanding Models 📝

## What are Models?
- Data structures that represent our app's information
- Blueprint for our data

```swift
// Simple example
struct Message {
    let content: String
    let isFromUser: Bool
    let timestamp: Date
}
```

---

# Our App's Model

## Message Model
- Content: What was said
- Who sent it (user or AI)
- When it was sent

---

# SwiftUI Basics 🔨

## Key Concepts:
- Views are functions of their state
- State management (@State)
- View composition
- Declarative syntax

---

# Afternoon Session: Chat Interface

## Components We'll Build:
1. Message Bubble
2. Chat View
3. Input Field
4. Send Button

---

# Message Bubble Design 💭

## Features:
- Different colors for user/AI
- Rounded corners
- Time stamp
- Dynamic sizing

```mermaid

    A[Message] --> B[User Bubble]
    A --> C[AI Bubble]
    B --> D[Blue Background]
    C --> E[Gray Background]
```

# Building the Chat View 📱

## Key Features:
- Scrollable message list
- Text input field

- Triggers view updates
- Simple value types

Example:
```swift
@State private var messages: [Message] = []
@State private var inputText = ""
```
